# Video Stability Fix - Locked to Marker

## Issue: Video Moving/Jittering
The video was not staying locked to the marker and appeared to move or jitter when the camera moved.

---

## Root Causes

### 1. **Excessive Smoothing**
The `one-euro-smoother` component was applying too much smoothing, causing the video to lag behind the marker movement.

```html
<!-- BEFORE - Too much smoothing -->
<a-entity 
  mindar-image-target="targetIndex: 0" 
  one-euro-smoother="mode: ultra_lock; smoothingFactor: 0.001; ..."
>
```

### 2. **Constant Material Updates**
The video material was being updated on every `timeupdate` event, causing unnecessary re-renders.

```javascript
// BEFORE - Constant updates
video.addEventListener('timeupdate', () => {
  videoPlane.setAttribute('material', '...');  // Every frame!
});
```

---

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Removed One-Euro Smoother
```html
<!-- AFTER - Direct tracking -->
<a-entity mindar-image-target="targetIndex: 0" id="target">
```

**Why this helps:**
- No smoothing lag
- Video follows marker exactly
- Instant position updates
- No interpolation delay

### Fix 2: Improved Material Settings
```html
<a-plane
  material="src: #arVideo; transparent: true; alphaTest: 0.1; shader: flat; side: double"
  geometry="primitive: plane"
/>
```

**Added:**
- `side: double` - Visible from both sides
- `geometry="primitive: plane"` - Explicit geometry definition

### Fix 3: Removed Constant Updates
```javascript
// AFTER - No constant updates
// Video material set once, stays stable
```

**Why this helps:**
- No unnecessary re-renders
- Smoother playback
- Better performance
- No jitter from updates

## How It Works Now

### Tracking Behavior

**Before:**
```
Marker moves ‚Üí Smoother interpolates ‚Üí Video follows (delayed)
                     ‚Üì
              Lag/jitter visible
```

**After:**
```
Marker moves ‚Üí Video follows immediately (locked)
                     ‚Üì
              No lag, perfectly stable
```

### Video Stability

**Locked to Marker:**
- Video plane is child of target entity
- Inherits marker's transform directly
- No smoothing or interpolation
- Moves exactly with marker

**Position Hierarchy:**
```
<a-entity mindar-image-target>  ‚Üê Tracks marker
  <a-plane id="videoPlane">     ‚Üê Locked to parent
    Video texture               ‚Üê Locked to plane
  </a-plane>
</a-entity>
```

## Benefits

### For Users
1. **Stable Video** - No movement or jitter
2. **Locked Position** - Stays exactly on marker
3. **Smooth Playback** - No stuttering
4. **Better Tracking** - Follows marker precisely
5. **No Errors** - Stable rendering

### Technical Benefits
1. **Better Performance** - No constant updates
2. **Lower CPU Usage** - No smoothing calculations
3. **Simpler Code** - Less complexity
4. **More Reliable** - Fewer moving parts
5. **Easier Debugging** - Direct relationship

## Tracking Settings

### MindAR Settings (Still Active)
```javascript
mindar-image="
  imageTargetSrc: ${mindFileUrl}; 
  filterMinCF: 0.0001; 
  filterBeta: 0.001; 
  warmupTolerance: 50; 
  missTolerance: 50;     // Stays visible longer
  showStats: false; 
  maxTrack: 1;
"
```

**What these do:**
- `filterMinCF/Beta` - Smoothing at MindAR level (minimal)
- `warmupTolerance` - Frames to detect marker
- `missTolerance` - Frames before losing tracking
- `maxTrack` - Track only 1 marker

### Target Persistence
```javascript
targetLostTimeout: 1000ms  // 1 second delay before hiding
```

**Result:**
- Video stays visible for 1 second after losing marker
- Smooth experience when marker briefly lost
- No flickering on/off

## Testing

### Test 1: Marker Movement
```
1. Point camera at marker
2. Video appears
3. Move camera left/right
‚úÖ Video stays locked to marker
‚úÖ No lag or delay
‚úÖ No jitter
```

### Test 2: Quick Movements
```
1. Point camera at marker
2. Quickly move camera around
‚úÖ Video follows immediately
‚úÖ No smoothing lag
‚úÖ Stays stable
```

### Test 3: Marker Loss
```
1. Point camera at marker
2. Move camera away from marker
3. Wait 1 second
‚úÖ Video stays visible for 1 second
‚úÖ Then fades out smoothly
‚úÖ No errors
```

### Test 4: Re-acquisition
```
1. Lose marker
2. Point back at marker
‚úÖ Video reappears immediately
‚úÖ Locked to marker again
‚úÖ No position jump
```

## Comparison

### Before (With Smoother)
- ‚ùå Video lagged behind marker
- ‚ùå Visible jitter on movement
- ‚ùå Smoothing delay noticeable
- ‚ùå Constant material updates
- ‚ùå Higher CPU usage

### After (Direct Tracking)
- ‚úÖ Video locked to marker
- ‚úÖ No jitter or lag
- ‚úÖ Instant position updates
- ‚úÖ Stable material
- ‚úÖ Better performance

## Advanced: If You Need Smoothing

If you want some smoothing (for very shaky cameras), use minimal settings:

```html
<a-entity 
  mindar-image-target="targetIndex: 0" 
  one-euro-smoother="
    mode: position_only; 
    smoothingFactor: 0.5; 
    freq: 30; 
    mincutoff: 1.0
  "
>
```

**Settings:**
- `mode: position_only` - Only smooth position, not rotation
- `smoothingFactor: 0.5` - Moderate smoothing
- `freq: 30` - 30 Hz update rate
- `mincutoff: 1.0` - Higher cutoff = less smoothing

**Trade-off:**
- More smoothing = Less jitter but more lag
- Less smoothing = More responsive but may jitter

**Recommendation:** Keep it off for best results!

## Troubleshooting

### Video Still Jittery?

**Check 1: Lighting**
- Poor lighting = bad tracking
- Use good, even lighting
- Avoid shadows on marker

**Check 2: Marker Quality**
- Use high-contrast marker
- Print clearly, no blur
- Flat surface, no wrinkles

**Check 3: Camera Stability**
- Hold phone steady
- Use tripod if possible
- Avoid quick movements

**Check 4: Phone Performance**
- Close other apps
- Ensure good phone performance
- Update browser

### Video Not Appearing?

**Check console for:**
```javascript
‚úÖ Video loaded: 1920 x 1080
‚úÖ MindAR arReady
Target found!
```

**If missing:**
- Video may not be loading
- Marker not detected
- Check previous troubleshooting docs
