## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```typescript
// Preview URL states
const [videoPreviewUrl, setVideoPreviewUrl] = useState<string | null>(null)
const [modelPreviewUrl, setModelPreviewUrl] = useState<string | null>(null)
const [markerPreviewUrl, setMarkerPreviewUrl] = useState<string | null>(null)
```

### Object URL Creation
When files are uploaded, preview URLs are created using `URL.createObjectURL()`:

```typescript
// Video upload
const previewUrl = URL.createObjectURL(file)
setVideoPreviewUrl(previewUrl)

// 3D model upload
const previewUrl = URL.createObjectURL(file)
setModelPreviewUrl(previewUrl)

// Marker image upload
const previewUrl = URL.createObjectURL(file)
setMarkerPreviewUrl(previewUrl)
```

### Memory Management
Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks:

```typescript
// Cleanup on component unmount
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {
    if (videoPreviewUrl) URL.revokeObjectURL(videoPreviewUrl)
    if (modelPreviewUrl) URL.revokeObjectURL(modelPreviewUrl)
    if (markerPreviewUrl) URL.revokeObjectURL(markerPreviewUrl)
  }
}, [videoPreviewUrl, modelPreviewUrl, markerPreviewUrl])

// Cleanup when file is removed
const removeFile = (type) => {
  if (type === 'video' && videoPreviewUrl) {
    URL.revokeObjectURL(videoPreviewUrl)
    setVideoPreviewUrl(null)
  }
  // ... similar for other types
}
```

### 3D Model Viewer Integration
```typescript
// TypeScript declaration
declare global {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements {
      'model-viewer': any
    }
  }
}

// Script loading
<Script 
  type="module" 
  src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/model-viewer/3.3.0/model-viewer.min.js"
/>

// Usage
<model-viewer
  src={modelPreviewUrl}
  alt="3D model preview"
  auto-rotate
  camera-controls
  style={{width: '100%', height: '100%'}}
/>
```

## UI Components

### Video Preview Component
```tsx
{videoPreviewUrl && (
  <div className="mt-4">
    <video 
      src={videoPreviewUrl} 
      controls 
      className="w-full max-h-64 rounded-lg border-2 border-black"
    />
    <p className="text-xs text-black opacity-70 mt-2">Preview</p>
  </div>
)}
```

### 3D Model Preview Component
```tsx
{modelPreviewUrl && (
  <div className="mt-4">
    <div className="w-full h-64 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg border-2 border-black flex items-center justify-center">
      <model-viewer
        src={modelPreviewUrl}
        alt="3D model preview"
        auto-rotate
        camera-controls
        style={{width: '100%', height: '100%'}}
      />
    </div>
    <p className="text-xs text-black opacity-70 mt-2">Preview - Drag to rotate</p>
  </div>
)}
```

### Marker Image Preview Component
```tsx
{markerPreviewUrl && (
  <div className="mt-4">
    <img 
      src={markerPreviewUrl} 
      alt="Marker preview" 
      className="max-w-full max-h-64 mx-auto rounded-lg border-2 border-black"
    />
    <p className="text-xs text-black opacity-70 mt-2">Marker Image Preview</p>
  </div>
)}
```
